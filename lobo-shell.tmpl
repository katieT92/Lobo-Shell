               LOBO SHELL
               ==========

---- EXPLORE THE PROBLEM ----

>> A1: To open a file for I/O re-direction requires various flags
>> and parameters passed to the open() call. Explore bash as an
>> example shell and list the parameters used in
>>     open(bar,...)
>> for each of these scenarios:
>>   (i) foo > bar
>>  (ii) foo < bar
>> (iii) foo >> bar

>> A2: Create scenarios to test and describe how bash behaves in
>> each of these scenarios:
>>   (i) foo < bar, when "bar" does not exist?
>>  (ii) foo < bar, when "bar" exists but you lack permission to read it?
>> (iii) foo > bar, when "bar" exists but you lack permission to write it?
>>  (iv) foo > bar, when "bar" cannot be created?
>> In each case, give the commands you used to create and evaluate 
>> the scenario.

>> A3: Unix pipes allow synchronization among processes to facilitate
>> interprocess communication (IPC). Consider a pipeline of arbitrary
>> length, like:
>>     P[0] | P[1] | ... | P[i-1] | P[i] | P[i+1] | ... | P[n]
>> Imagine a loop, like:
>>     for i in 0 .. n: 
>>         set-up-pipeline-for( process P[i] )
>> What prior-created pipes would be used with process P[i]?
>> What new pipes need to be created to set up P[i]'s pipeline?

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A4: Copy here the declaration of each new `struct',
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- FUNCTIONS ----

>> A5: Provide a prototype and documentation for each function
>> you have introduced to support this portion of the project.
>> Use the Google Style Guide for function documentation.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A6: Briefly describe how the functions (from A3) are called
>> when your shell is processing the user-entered commands:
>>   foo 1 2 | bar 3 4

>> A7: Briefly describe your approch for reaping child processes. When do
>> you reap, and how much do you reap at a time? Would it be possible to
>> reap children earlier than your current implementation and, if so,
>> what situations might that benefit?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A8: Does any aspect of our shell require multithreading or related
>> synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores)? Is the bash shell
>> (http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/) multithreaded?
>> What did you grep to determine the answer?

>> A9: Develop a new test, not covered by existing tests. Provide the 
>> code implementing that test. When possible, follow the format of 
>> existing tests. Explain what functionality it tests and how it goes 
>> beyond the provided tests.




               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Any other comments?
